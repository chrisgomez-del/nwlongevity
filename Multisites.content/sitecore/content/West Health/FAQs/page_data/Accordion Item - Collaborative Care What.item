<p>The Collaborative Care Model is a team-based approach to addressing mental health concerns such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. It involves three key specialists working together to treat and monitor a patient&rsquo;s progress. This approach is patient-centered, population-based, accountable and evidence-based, and measures treatment outcomes using validated methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide comprehensive and easily accessible mental health care, the team is equipped with a behavioral health care manager, psychiatrist, and primary care provider. These experts provide a deep knowledge of mental health conditions and treatments and ensure the patient&rsquo;s primary care clinic is supported in delivering treatment methods. The Collaborative Care Model was first developed by researchers at the AIMS Center at University of Washington in 2011.&nbsp;</p>
